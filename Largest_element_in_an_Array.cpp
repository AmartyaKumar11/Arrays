Brute Force Approach : 
We can sort the array in ascending order, hence the largest element will be at the last index of the array.
Time Complexity: O(N*log(N))
Space Complexity: O(n)

Recursive Approach :
We can maintain a max variable that will update whenever the current value is greater than the value in the max variable.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
