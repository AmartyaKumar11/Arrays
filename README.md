# C++ Array Data Structure

### This repository is a one-stop shop for learning and practicing C++ array concepts! It provides clear explanations, code examples, and a curated list of LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks problems for all skill levels (easy, medium, hard).

### Introduction : 

A concise overview of arrays in C++: definition, declaration, initialization, accessing elements, and advantages/disadvantages.
Briefly touch on multidimensional arrays if you plan to include them.
Basic Operations

Code examples demonstrating:

Array declaration and initialization (including dynamic memory allocation using new and potential pitfalls),
Element access using indexing (remembering 0-based indexing!),
Traversing an array using loops (for, while),
Searching for elements (linear, binary if applicable),
Sorting an array (built-in functions like sort or manual implementations),
Common array operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, resizing with caution)

### Advanced Concepts :

(Optional) If you plan to cover more advanced topics, include sections on:

1) Passing arrays to functions (by reference to avoid copying large arrays)

2) Multidimensional arrays (declaration, initialization, access)

3) Memory management considerations (potential for memory leaks with dynamic allocation)

# Practice Problems :

A well-organized list of LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks problems categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard) to test your understanding of arrays.
